BlackLight/README

BlackLight is an open-source library for autonomic radios.

An autonomic radio is a wireless transceiver with complete and exclusive control
over the signals it transmits and receives.
This is in contrast to conventional radios, such as smartphones,
which are subject to control by external entities.

The library contains design files under an open-source license.
The design files are the property of the BlackLight Trust.
The design files can be used to fabricate autonomic radios.

"Black" comes from the secure communications industry and connotes 
a protected signal. "Light" signifies wideband electromagnetic radiation.
