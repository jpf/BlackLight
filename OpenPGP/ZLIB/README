BlackLight OpenPGP uses the ZLIB compression algorithm.
The source file "zlib.lisp" specifies zlib-deflate and zlib-inflate.
The source file "uv-zlib.c" specifies _uv_deflate and _uv_inflate.
zlib-deflate calls _uv_deflate and zlib-inflate calls _uv_inflate.
Both _uv_deflate and _uv_inflate are provided in "libz.dylib"
via the Clozure Common Lisp Foreign Function Inteface (CCL FFI).
libz.dylib is a customized zlib version 1.2.5 shared library.

Here's how libz.dylib was built:
The zlib-1.2.5 distribution was download and installed.
A link to "uv-zlib.c" was created in the zlib-1.2.5 directory.
Two zlib-1.2.5 source files were modified: "Makefile" and "zconf.h.cmakein".

To generate a new libz.dylib shared library:

  - Download an install zlib-1.2.5
  - Create link to uv-zlib.c
  - Replace Makefile
  - Replace zconf.h.cmakein
  - Type "make install"

To open the shared library in BlackLight:

  ? (open-shared-library "ZLIB/libz.dylib")

The shared library will have the two symbols "_uv_deflate" and "_uv_inflate".
Use the CCL-FFI "external" operator to verify this.

  ? (external "_uv_deflate")
  ? (external "_uv_inflate")
