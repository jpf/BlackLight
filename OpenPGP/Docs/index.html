<a href="RFC-4880.html"> RFC 4880 </a><br>
This document provides information on the message-exchange packet
formats used by OpenPGP to provide encryption, decryption, signing,
and key management functions.
<p>

<a href="openpgp-notes.html"> OpenPGP notes </a><br>
These notes are the result of a thorough study of RFC-4880,
plus other documents that RFC-4880 cites.
These notes provide the bulk of the BlackLight requirements.

<a href="why-RSA-works.pdf"> Why RSA Works </a><br>
The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm (RSA) is a well-established 
computational method for public-key cryptography.
We offer the reader an understanding of why RSA works.
A simple proof of the RSA identity is developed using 
an illustrative approach. Table 5 is particularly revealing.

<a href="FIPS-180-2.pdf"> FIPS PUB 180-2 </a><br>
<i>Secure Hash Standard.</i>
This standard specifies four secure hash algorithms, 
SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.
All four of the algorithms are iterative, one-way hash functions that can 
process a message to produce a condensed representation called a message digest. 
These algorithms enable the determination of a message's integrity: 
any change to the message will, with a very high probability, 
result in a different message digest.
This property is useful in the generation and verification of digital signatures 
and message authentication codes, and in the generation of random numbers (bits).
<p>

<a href="FIPS-197.pdf"> FIPS PUB 197 </a><br>
<i>Advanced Encryption Standard.</i>
This standard specifies the Rijndael algorithm, 
a symmetric block cipher that can process data blocks of 128 bits, 
using cipher keys with lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits. 
Rijndael was designed to handle additional block sizes and key lengths, 
however they are not adopted in this standard.
<p>

<a href="FIPS-197-notes.pdf"> FIPS 197 notes </a><br>
New readers of FIPS-197 may find themselves faced with a steep learning curve.
These notes address some of the more difficult topics.
In order to provide synchronization,
the section headings are identical to those in FIPS-197.

<i> OpenPGP Message Format. </i>
This document provides information on the message-exchange packet formats 
used by OpenPGP to provide encryption, decryption, signing, and key management 
functions.  It is a revision of RFC 2440, "OpenPGP Message Format", which itself 
replaces RFC 1991, "PGP Message Exchange Formats."
<p>

<a href="rfc4086.txt"> RFC 4086 </a><br>
<i>Randomness Requirements for Security.</i>
Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated
adversary is surprisingly difficult.  This document points out many
pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random
number generation techniques for generating such quantities.  It
recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that
the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose.
It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware
solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such
quantities need to be for some applications.

<a href="rfc3447.txt"> RFC 3447 </a><br>
<i> PKCS #1: RSA Encryption </i>
This memo represents a republication of PKCS #1 v2.1 from RSA
Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series, and
change control is retained within the PKCS process.  The body of this
document is taken directly from the PKCS #1 v2.1 document, with
certain corrections made during the publication process.
This document provides recommendations for the implementation of
public-key cryptography based on the RSA algorithm.
<p>

<a href="rfc2440.txt"> RFC 2440 </a><br>
<i>OpenPGP Message Format. </i>
This document provides information on the message-exchange packet
formats used by OpenPGP to provide encryption, decryption, signing,
and key management functions. It builds on the foundation provided in
RFC 1991 "PGP Message Exchange Formats."
<p>

<a href="rfc2279.txt"> RFC 2279 </a><br>
<i>UTF-8: a transformation format of ISO 10646.</i>
ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a multi-octet character set called the
Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's
writing systems. Multi-octet characters, however, are not compatible
with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the
development of a few so-called UCS transformation formats (UTF), each
with different characteristics.  UTF-8, the object of this memo, has
the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing
compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely
on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.
<p>

<a href="rfc2144.txt"> RFC 2144 </a><br>
<i>The CAST-128 Encryption Algorithm.</i>
This document describes the CAST-128 encryption algorithm, a DES-like
Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) cryptosystem which appears to
have good resistance to differential cryptanalysis, linear
cryptanalysis, and related-key cryptanalysis.  This cipher also
possesses a number of other desirable cryptographic properties,
including avalanche, Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC), Bit
Independence Criterion (BIC), no complementation property, and an
absence of weak and semi-weak keys.
<p>

<a href="rfc2045.txt"> RFC 2045 </a><br>
<i>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.</i>
This set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, 
or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for
(1) textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,
(2) an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message bodies,
(3) multi-part message bodies, and
(4) textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.
<p>

<a href="rfc1991.txt"> RFC 1991 </a><br>
<i>PGP Message Exchange Formats.</i>
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) uses a combination of public-key and
conventional encryption to provide security services for electronic
mail messages and data files.  These services include confidentiality
and digital signature.  PGP is widely used throughout the global
computer community.  This document describes the format of "PGP
files", i.e., messages that have been encrypted and/or signed with PGP.
<p>

<a href="rfc1951.txt"> RFC 1951 </a><br>
<i>DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification.</i>
This specification defines a lossless compressed data format 
that compresses data using a combination of the LZ77 algorithm and 
Huffman coding, with efficiency comparable to the best currently available
general-purpose compression methods.
The data can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long 
sequentially presented input data stream, using only an a priori 
bounded amount of intermediate storage.  The format can be implemented 
readily in a manner not covered by patents.
<p>

<a href="rfc1950.txt"> RFC 1950 </a><br>
<i>ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification.</i>
This specification defines a lossless compressed data format.
The data can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long
sequentially presented input data stream, using only an a priori
bounded amount of intermediate storage.  The format presently uses
the DEFLATE compression method but can be easily extended to use
other compression methods.  It can be implemented readily in a manner
not covered by patents.  This specification also defines the ADLER-32
checksum (an extension and improvement of the Fletcher checksum),
used for detection of data corruption, and provides an algorithm for computing it.
