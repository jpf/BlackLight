<h1> BlackLight OpenPGP <br> Startup Guide </h1>


This page describes how to start up the BlackLight OpenPGP subsystem.
<p>
In these examples we use Clozure Common Lisp (CCL), formerly known as OpenMCL.
It's best to use CCL in an Emacs shell, although it's not absolutely necessary.
We'll assume that you have a Unix system with CCL installed,
and that you are able to open two terminal windows simultaneously.
<p>
The CCL REPL prompt is a question mark (<tt> ? </tt>).<br>
The Unix shell prompt is a dollar sign (<tt> $ </tt>).


<h2> Boot the system </h2>

Open the first terminal window.
Change to the Code directory and start CCL.
<blockquote><pre>
$ cd ~/BlackLight/OpenPGP/Code/
$ /Applications/OpenMCL/dppccl
? 
</pre></blockquote>

The next step is to load a bootstrap program.
Compile the system file and then load it.
<blockquote><pre>
? (compile-file "system")
? (load "system")
</pre></blockquote>

If the system has not already been built, then run system-make.
When system-make finishes, it prints DONE.
<blockquote><pre>
? (system-make)
</pre></blockquote>

If the system has already been built, we can simply load it.
When system-load finishes, it prints DONE.
<blockquote><pre>
? (system-load)
</pre></blockquote>

Now we test each module.
This gives us a certain amount of assurance that each module is okay.
A few modules take a while to complete their test, e.g. keys and comm.
When a module passes its test, an "okay" is printed.
When system-test finishes, it prints DONE.
<blockquote><pre>
? (system-test)
</pre></blockquote>

If you need to modify one or more source files, you must recompile them.
This is accomplished by simply running system-make, which will compile
each .lisp file that is newer than its respective .dfsl file.
<blockquote><pre>
? (system-make)
</pre></blockquote>


<h2> Zeta and Zane </h2>

We introduce two hypothetical users, Zeta and Zane.
We're going to simulate an exchange of messages between them.
First Zane will transmit a short text message to Zeta.
Then Zeta will transmit a file to Zane.
<p>
We wanted to make this Startup Guide easy to follow.
Therefore we've prefabricated keys for Zeta and Zane.
This lets us avoid most of the fuss with keys and keyrings, at least temporarily.
We'll put off key operations until later.
<p>
First, Zane transmits a short text message to Zeta.
We assume that Zane has successfully booted his system,
has successfully run system-test, and has the "<tt>?</tt>" prompt
in the first terminal window.
Zane assembles a short message into the transmit form tx-form, 
encodes it with comm-encode, and writes the result into the file zzzz.pgp.
<blockquote><pre>
? (setf tx-mssg "Please send me RFC 1991.")
? (setf tx-form (list 'COMM (date) "Zeta" "Zane" "..." (split-str tx-mssg)))
? (setf tx-code (comm-encode tx-form))
? (putfile "../Test/zzzz.pgp" tx-code)
</pre></blockquote>

Zeta now receives the text message sent by Zane.
To simplify this demonstration, Zeta uses the same terminal window as Zane.
She gets the encoded data from zzzz.pgp, decodes it with comm-decode,
reads the message, and finally deletes the file zzzz.pgp
so it doesn't clutter up the Test directory.
<blockquote><pre>
? (setf rx-code (getfile "../Test/zzzz.pgp"))
? (setf rx-form (comm-decode rx-code))
? (setf rx-mssg (unite-str (nth 5 rx-form)))
? (delete-file "../Test/zzzz.pgp")
</pre></blockquote>

Next, Zeta transmits a file to Zane.
She specifies the name of the transmit file and the path.
She then reads the file data and creates a communique form.
Finally she encodes the communique and writes the file to zzzz.pgp.
The lists tx-data, tx-form, and tx-code are very long.
Zeta therefore employs the length operator to print the length of each list
instead of the contents of each list.
<blockquote><pre>
? (setf tx-file "rfc1991.txt")
? (setf tx-path (format nil "../Docs/~A" tx-file))
? (length (setf tx-data (getfile tx-path)))
? (length (setf tx-form (list 'COMM (date) "Zeta" "Zane" tx-file tx-data)))
? (length (setf tx-code (comm-encode tx-form)))
? (putfile "../Test/zzzz.pgp" tx-code)
</pre></blockquote>

Zane receives the file sent by Zeta.
He reads the zzzz.pgp file and decodes the communique.
Then he takes the decoded data and writes it to a file in Test.
Finally he deletes zzzz.pgp.
<blockquote><pre>
? (length (setf rx-code (getfile "../Test/zzzz.pgp")))
? (length (setf rx-form (comm-decode rx-code)))
? (length (setf rx-data (nth 5 rx-form)))
? (setf rx-file (nth 4 rx-form))
? (setf rx-path (format nil "../Test/~A" rx-file))
? (putfile rx-path rx-data)
? (delete-file "../Test/zzzz.pgp")
</pre></blockquote>

Zane uses the second terminal window and changes to the Test directory.
Then he uses the diff command to verify that the received file 
is identical to the transmitted file.
He then deletes the received file from the Test directory.
<blockquote><pre>
$ cd ~/BlackLight/OpenPGP/Test
$ diff rfc1991.txt ../Docs/rfc1991.txt
$ rm rfc1991.txt
</pre></blockquote>


<h2> Genny and Blake </h2>

We introduce two additional hypothetical users, Genny and Blake.
We want to demonstrate that BlackLight OpenPGP (UV) complies with 
the OpenPGP standard specified in RFC-4880.
We'll use an alternate OpenPGP implementation, namely GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).
So Blake uses UV and Genny uses GPG.
<p>
To begin, Blake transmits a large file to Genny.
He uses the first terminal window, the one running CCL.
He specifies the name of the file and the path of the source.
He gets the file date and creates a communique form.
Then he encodes the communique and writes the result 
into the file zzzz.pgp.
<blockquote><pre>
? (setf tx-file "rfc1991.txt")
? (setf tx-path (format nil "../Docs/~A" tx-file))
? (length (setf tx-data (getfile tx-path)))
? (length (setf tx-form (list 'COMM (date) "Blake" "Genny" tx-file tx-data)))
? (length (setf tx-code (comm-encode tx-form)))
? (putfile "../Test/zzzz.pgp" tx-code)
</pre></blockquote>

Genny receives the file sent by Blake.
In the second terminal window, she uses a gpg command to decode zzzz.pgp
and write the result into rfc1991.txt in the Test directory.
She then uses the diff command to verify that the file she received
is exactly the same as the original file.
Finally, she deletes rfc1991.txt and zzzz.pgp.
<blockquote><pre>
$ cd ~/BlackLight/OpenPGP/Test/
$ gpg -o rfc1991.txt --options gpg.conf -d zzzz.pgp
$ diff rfc1991.txt ../Docs/rfc1991.txt
$ rm rfc1991.txt zzzz.pgp
</pre></blockquote>

Now it's Genny's turn to transmit a large file to Blake.
She uses a gpg command to sign and encrypt rfc2440.txt
and write the result into zzzz.pgp.
<blockquote><pre>
$ gpg -o zzzz.pgp --options gpg.conf -se -r Blake ../Docs/rfc2440.txt
</pre></blockquote>


Blake receives the file sent by Genny.
He gets the file data from zzzz.pgp and decodes it into a communique form.
Then he writes the decoded data into the rfc2440.txt file in the Test directory.
<blockquote><pre>
? (length (setf rx-code (getfile "../Test/zzzz.pgp")))
? (length (setf rx-form (comm-decode rx-code)))
? (length (setf rx-data (nth 5 rx-form)))
? (setf rx-file (nth 4 rx-form))
? (setf rx-path (format nil "../Test/~A" rx-file))
? (putfile rx-path rx-data)
</pre></blockquote>

Blake switches to the second terminal window.
He uses the diff command to verify that the file he received
is exactly the same as the original file.
Finally, he deletes rfc2440.txt and zzzz.pgp.
<blockquote><pre>
$ cd ~/BlackLight/OpenPGP/Test/
$ diff rfc2440.txt ../Docs/rfc2440.txt
$ rm rfc2440.txt zzzz.pgp
</pre></blockquote>


<h2> Key operations </h2>

We've postponed dealing with keys.
Now it's time to learn several key operations.
First, we'll create a local keyfile for someone, say Tom.
We need to decide the name of the keyfile (Tom.loc),
the directory to put it in (Test),
and the approximate size of the keys (1023.95 bits).
<blockquote><pre>
? (create-local-keyfile "../Test" "Tom" 1023.95)
</pre></blockquote>

Next, we'll export Tom's keys.
We'll take the keyfile we just created (Tom.loc)
and create a PGP certificate (Tom.pgp).
<blockquote><pre>
? (cert-export "../Test/Tom.loc" "../Test/Tom.pgp")
</pre></blockquote>


Finally, we'll import Tom's keys.
We'll take the certificate we just created (Tom.pgp)
and create a remote keyfile (Tom.rem).
<blockquote><pre>
? (cert-import "../Test/Tom.pgp" "../Test/Tom.rem")
</pre></blockquote>

Since this was just an exercise, we delete the three keys
so they don't clutter up the Test directory.
<blockquote><pre>
? (delete-file "../Test/Tom.loc")
? (delete-file "../Test/Tom.pgp")
? (delete-file "../Test/Tom.rem")
</pre></blockquote>

In normal practice, we would move the local keyfile (Tom.loc) 
to a directory, say My-Keys, with all of our other keys.
We would also need to add "Tom.loc" to a <tt>LOAD-KEYS</tt> file in My-Keys.
<tt>LOAD-KEYS</tt> is a list of keyfiles and is read by the load-keyring function.
(See the Test directory for an example of the <tt>LOAD-KEYS</tt> file).
And to use our keys, we would need to load them.
<blockquote><pre>
? (load-keyring "../My-Keys")
</pre></blockquote>


<h2> Exit </h2>

To exit the CCL REPL, simply run quit.
<blockquote><pre>
? (quit)
</pre></blockquote>


<h2> Summary </h2>

This Startup Guide has shown 
how to send and receive messages within BlackLight (Zeta and Zane),
how to send and receive messages between BlackLight and Gnu Privacy Guard (Genny and Blake),
and how create, export, and import keys (Key operations).
